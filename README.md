# nodemcu_spotify_remote
A handheld remote for controlling and managing spotify playback

NONE OF THIS CODE HAS BEEN TESTING AND IT PROBABLY WON'T WORK
TODO: figure out authorization method, preferably decentralized (direct between spotify and esp)
TODO: Implement everything else

I can design the electronics and 3D model to print a case, but would appreciate any help I can get on the rest.
